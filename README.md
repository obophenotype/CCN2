# CCN2
Developing a successor to the CCN taxonomy system

Aims: 
 - Support existing use cases and workflows - particularly figure generation
 - Encourage the use of ontology terms where possible.
 - include evidence and provenance
 - Allow for expressiveness, but keep compulsory fields to a minimum
