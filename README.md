# CCN2
Developing a successor to the CCN taxonomy system (link TBA)

Aims: 
 - Support existing use cases and workflows - particularly figure generation
 - Improve robustness by using node and ontology ids in cross-referencing, rather than names/aliases.
 - Encourage the use of ontology terms where possible.
 - Support the inclusion of evidence and provenance
 - Allow for expressiveness, but keep compulsory fields to a minimum.
 
 
Schema and Documentation:
A formal JSON schema can be found at [src/schema/schema.json](src/schema/schema.json).  However, we expect users to interact with this schema via flattened tables in an editor tool and available as reports.  Documentation, user guidance for those tables as well as examples can be found under [doc](doc).
