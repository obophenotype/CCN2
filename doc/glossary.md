# Glossary of Terms

This document provides a glossary of terms used and their specific meaning in CCN. Note that these meanings might not apply generally outside CCN.

#### Accession
An ID given to a term.

#### Cell set
Any collection of cells within a specific taxonomy.

#### Cell Type Name
The preferred name, which will be shown in the dendrogram. This maps to "cell_set_preferred_alias"

#### Dendrogram
A diagrammatic representation of the taxonomy.

#### Mapping
A link between two nodes from different taxonomies. Maps to "cell_set_aligned_alias" in CCN1.0 but uses a different method of linking.

#### Ontology ID 
An ID of an ontology term in the form a CURIE (e.g. CL:0000001).

#### Ontology Name
The rdfs:Label of the ontology term. 

#### Provenance
The origin of an assertion. This maps to "citation" in CCN1.0 but is broader in that in can include more than just citations (e.g. datasets, ORCID, etc.).

#### Synonyms 
Alternative names for this cell type. Should be an exact match and should not include any names that are much narrower or broader. This maps to "alias" in general in CCN1.0, but "cell_set_additional_aliases" in particular.

#### Taxonomy 
The output of a computational algorithm applied to a specific dataset.
